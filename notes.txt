Ok so the specifics they wanted were an "about us" page with 3 vertical sections for each therapist - which we already
started working on, a blog page, and for the hero bar to be a slide bar. As far as the other photos for the hero bar,
it sounded like we could pick whatever looked good.

Also Janelle did send me an email last night saying she never heard back if she could get the font used in their logo.
She also asked for an update on the website. I told her we finished the contact page and we are hoping to wrap it up
over the weekend. Let me know if you need anything!
